# prometheus/go

This monitor scrapes [Prmoetheus Go
collector](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#NewGoCollector)
and [Prometheus process
collector](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#NewProcessCollector)
metrics from a Prometheus exporter and sends them to SignalFx.  It is a
wrapper around the [prometheus-exporter](./prometheus-exporter.md) monitor
that provides a restricted but expandable set of metrics.


Monitor Type: `prometheus/go`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/prometheus/go)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the exporter using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml
